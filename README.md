# Data_Visualization_Factory_Testbench
This script was made to automate a process we used to do manually. In this process we receive all the data for each batch of a electronic product manufactured in China each month, and we need to generate plots and analyze the Gaussian Distribution

After run the Script, you should get an initial screen asking the name of the file you want to analyze:
